# Terms of Service

**Last updated: 2 February 2026**

Thank you for using **OpClaw.io** (the **“Service”**). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms of Service (the **“Terms”**). If you do not accept all of the Terms, do not use the Service.

---

## 1. Who we are

“**We**”, “**us**”, and “**our**” mean the operators of OpClaw.io. “**You**” means the person or organisation using the Service.

---

## 2. Description of the Service

* The Service provides a **virtual private server (VPS)** with **pre-installed OpenClaw** and required dependencies.
* Current standard VPS specification (subject to change): **4 vCPU**, **8 GB RAM**, **150 GB SSD**.
* The Service is provided by subscription at **$10/month**, billed via Stripe.
* You receive **root (administrator) access** to your VPS. You are responsible for all configuration and ongoing operation.
* **Features, limits, specifications, pricing, and availability may change** at any time.

---

## 3. Accounts, payments, and provisioning

* You must provide accurate billing and contact details.
* Access is typically provisioned after successful payment confirmation.
* If a payment fails, we may suspend or terminate your access until payment is resolved.
* Taxes may apply depending on your location and applicable law.

---

## 4. Your VPS, root access, and security

* You are responsible for:

  * securing your VPS (passwords, SSH keys, firewalls, updates);
  * any software you install or run;
  * any data you store or process;
  * backups (unless we explicitly provide a backup feature).
* We recommend you:

  * disable password SSH logins and use SSH keys;
  * rotate secrets regularly;
  * keep OpenClaw and system packages updated.

---

## 5. Password resets and support access

* We (and our staff) **do not have login access to your VPS** while it is allocated to you.
* If you lose root access (e.g., forgot password / lost keys), we can perform a **root credential reset** from the infrastructure side **only if you request it**.
* Password resets are processed **only** when requested from the email address associated with your account by emailing **[support@opclaw.io](mailto:support@opclaw.io)**. We may ask for additional verification to prevent account takeover.
* A password reset may:

  * invalidate previous credentials/keys;
  * require downtime or a reboot;
  * result in loss of access if your configuration prevents login after reset (you remain responsible for VPS configuration).

---

## 6. Acceptable use

You agree **not** to use the Service to:

* violate any applicable laws or third-party rights;
* send spam, run phishing campaigns, or support unsolicited bulk messaging;
* create, host, or distribute malware, exploit code, or botnets;
* threaten or promote violence, terrorism, or harm;
* attempt unauthorised access to systems, networks, or data;
* bypass security controls, rate limits, payment requirements, or abuse safeguards;
* run activities that materially degrade the Service or infrastructure (including abusive load, scanning, or denial-of-service behaviour).

We may suspend or terminate access for suspected violations.

---

## 7. Compliance, abuse handling, and law enforcement requests

* You are solely responsible for your activity on the VPS.
* We may suspend, restrict, or terminate the Service for a particular user if:

  * automated or manual security checks indicate abuse, violence-related threats, malware, phishing, or other prohibited activity;
  * we receive a valid legal request or are required to act by law;
  * continuing service would create material security, legal, or operational risk.
* Where appropriate and lawful, we may provide notice before taking action, but we may act without notice in urgent situations.

---

## 8. Data, privacy, and logs

* Your VPS content is under your control. We do not access it by logging in.
* To operate and protect the Service, we may process limited operational data (for example: billing metadata, provisioning state, basic service logs, and security signals).
* If we publish a privacy notice or **PRIVACY.md**, it is incorporated by reference into these Terms.

---

## 9. Third-party services

* The Service relies on third-party providers (for example payment processing via Stripe, networking, and infrastructure).
* We are not responsible for third-party outages, changes, or failures outside our reasonable control.
* Your use of third-party services may be governed by their terms and policies.

---

## 10. Availability and changes

* The Service is provided on a **best-efforts** basis.
* We do not guarantee uptime, latency, throughput, or uninterrupted availability.
* Maintenance, upgrades, emergency work, and provider outages may cause downtime.
* We may change, replace, or withdraw parts of the Service at any time.

---

## 11. No warranties

The Service is provided **“as is”** and **“as available”**, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and availability.

---

## 12. Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive losses, or for loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business interruption arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Service.

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot lawfully be limited or excluded.

---

## 13. Indemnity

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:
(a) your use of the Service;
(b) your breach of these Terms; or
(c) your violation of third-party rights or applicable law.

---

## 14. Term, suspension, and termination

* These Terms apply while you use the Service.
* We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for reasons including:

  * suspected abuse, fraud, or security risk;
  * non-payment;
  * legal or compliance obligations;
  * operational necessity.
* If access is terminated for misuse or breach, you may forfeit prepaid fees, subject to applicable law and any mandatory consumer protections.

## 15. Billing, renewals, and refunds

* Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled through the payment flow/provider.
* Refunds (if any) follow the terms shown at purchase and any mandatory consumer protection laws that apply to you.
