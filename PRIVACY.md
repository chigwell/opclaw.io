# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2 February 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **OpClaw.io** (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects and processes personal data when you use our website and VPS provisioning service (the “Service”). We operate from the **United Kingdom** and comply with the **UK GDPR** and, where applicable, the **EU GDPR**.

## 1. Controller contact

**Controller:** OpClaw.io (operated by an individual)
**Email:** [support@opclaw.io](mailto:support@opclaw.io)

---

## 2. Data we collect

Account & support

* Email address (used for account administration and support).
* Support communications you send to us (for example password reset requests) and our replies.

Billing (payments)

* Subscription status, invoice/receipt metadata, and payment identifiers processed via **Stripe**.
* We do **not** store your full card details on our servers.

Service operation (VPS provisioning)

* Provisioning metadata: plan (currently 4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM / 150 GB SSD), provisioning timestamps, service state (active/suspended), and technical identifiers needed to allocate and manage the VPS.
* The public IP address assigned to the VPS (as part of provisioning/operation records).

Network & security

* Our edge/network provider **Cloudflare** may process IP addresses, request metadata, timestamps, and security events to deliver and protect the website and related service endpoints.
* Abuse/security signals necessary to detect malware, phishing, violence-related threats, or other prohibited activity, and to protect the Service and third parties.

VPS content

* You have root access to your VPS and control what you install and run.
* We do not log in to your VPS or access your VPS content as part of normal operations. (However, infrastructure providers may process limited technical data required to run the VPS platform.)

We do **not** intentionally collect special category data. We do **not** sell personal data.

---

## 3. Purposes and legal bases

We process personal data for:

Provide and operate the Service (account support, provisioning, ongoing operation)

* Legal basis: **Contract** (UK GDPR / GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)).

Billing and subscription management (status, invoices/receipts, payment confirmation)

* Legal basis: **Contract** (Art. 6(1)(b)).
* Payment processing is performed by Stripe as an independent processor/controller for parts of the payment flow, depending on the context.

Security, abuse prevention, and service reliability (rate limits, fraud prevention, incident response, debugging)

* Legal basis: **Legitimate interests** (Art. 6(1)(f)).

Legal compliance (responding to lawful requests, enforcing our Terms, preventing harm)

* Legal basis: **Legal obligation** (Art. 6(1)(c)) and/or **Legitimate interests** (Art. 6(1)(f)), depending on the scenario.

Communications

* Transactional/service emails (provisioning, password resets you request, security/incident notices, material changes)

  * Legal basis: **Contract** (Art. 6(1)(b)).
* Optional product updates/announcements

  * Legal basis: **Consent** (Art. 6(1)(a)) or, where permitted, **Legitimate interests** with a clear opt-out.

---

## 4. Processors, hosting, and international transfers

We use third-party providers to operate the Service, including:

* **Cloudflare** for DNS, security, and delivery of the website and related endpoints.
* **Stripe** for payment processing.
* VPS infrastructure providers to provision and run VPS instances.

These providers may process personal data on our behalf under their data protection terms. Data may be transferred internationally depending on provider infrastructure. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (for example Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK Addendum) as implemented by relevant providers.

---

## 5. Sharing

We share personal data only with:

* Service providers (processors) strictly to operate, secure, and bill for the Service (for example Cloudflare, Stripe, and VPS infrastructure providers); and
* Public authorities or other parties where required by law, or where necessary to address abuse, security incidents, or threats of harm.

---

## 6. Communications

We may send:

* Transactional/service emails required to operate your account and the Service (including responding to password reset requests you make from your account email).
* Optional updates and announcements, only with consent or (where permitted) legitimate interests with a clear opt-out.

---

## 7. Retention

* Account and support data: retained while your account is active and as needed to provide support and prevent abuse.
* Billing records: retained as required for accounting/tax and dispute handling.
* Security and operational logs: retained only as long as reasonably necessary for security, reliability, and abuse prevention.

When you request deletion (and where we can delete without breaking legal obligations), we aim to delete or anonymise personal data within **30 days**. Residual backups, if any, may persist for a limited period before being purged as part of normal backup rotation.

---

## 8. Your rights

Depending on your location (UK/EEA), you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, portability, object (legitimate interests), and withdraw consent (where processing is consent-based).

To exercise your rights, contact **[support@opclaw.io](mailto:support@opclaw.io)**.

---

## 9. Cookies and similar technologies

We use only strictly necessary cookies/storage for authentication, security, and core operation of the website and Service. Cloudflare may set cookies required for security and bot protection. We do not use third-party advertising cookies for the Service.

---

## 10. Automated decision-making

We use automated security and abuse-prevention controls (for example rate limiting and threat detection) that may restrict or suspend access. These controls do not involve decisions producing legal or similarly significant effects in the GDPR sense, but they may affect service availability for your account.

---

## 11. Children

The Service is not directed to children. If you are under 13 (or the minimum age in your country), do not use the Service. If we learn we have collected personal data from a child, we will delete it.

---

## 12. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted with a new “Last updated” date. If changes are material, we will provide reasonable notice where practical (for example by email or a site notice). Continued use after updates means you accept the revised Policy.
